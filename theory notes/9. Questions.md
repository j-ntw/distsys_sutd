how come we cant order it as P1 -> P4 -> P2 -> P3

- where does pre-prepare come from
# PBFT
- Why primary only needs f+1 to reply successful execution to client, but all other stages among the replicas needs 2f+1?
	- The client only needs to know the agreed decision
	- It doesn't need to know if the machines are faulty
	- So as long as it has f+1 matching responses, then at least 1 of the responses must come from an honest machine, so the matching responses are valid
- There is also a difference between sending and receiving replies.
	- we need 3f+1 replicas, tolerating f dropped msgs and f malicious msgs, leaving f+1 majority over the f msgs that are malicious (worst case)
	- in better than worst case, u will have more than f+1 matching replies.
	- so client finds f+1 matching replies, it has majority already and can decide.
	- for replicas, it needs to decide between multiple values, so it needs 2f+1
