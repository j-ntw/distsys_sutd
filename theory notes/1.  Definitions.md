Safety: Certain properties are never violated, e.g. Read/Write are atomic. "nothing bad ever happens."
Fairness: every process has equal chance to enter CS (Dist Mutex) or get fair share of resources.
Liveness:  progress of a system. Does not deadlock in a non-terminating state. "something good will eventually happen."

Message Complexity: number of messages exchanged in O(N) notation
Sync Delay: how long does it take
Single point of failure: Bad.

## 2. Clocks and Elections
Cristian's Algorithm:
Berkeley Algo:
Bully Algo: biggest pid wins.
Causality Violation 
NTP: network time protocol. has strata, lower strata get from higher strata. supports high availability. highest strata gets time from highly accurate physical clocks.

## 3. Distributed Mutual Exclusion (DME)

Ring based Algo
Lamports shared priority queue
Ricart & Agrawala's modded Lamport shared p queue
Voting Protocol

## 4. Consistency
Sequential Consistency: There is some total store order, some way to chain from start to end. No cycle.

Causal Consistency: 

causally dependent actions are respected. e.g. if P3 write value a to var x, and var x is read before writing var y in P2, then var y write is causally dependent on write to var x.
