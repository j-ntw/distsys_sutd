# 2_1

Run with make as per normal, with 10 nodes from 0 to 9, node 9 will always become the leader and start broadcasting its own data to the other nodes.

## Flags
`-w`: worst case
`-b`: best case
`-f`: failure during election
`-ff`: 2nd type of failure
`-m`: multiple, simultaneous election
`-d`: arbitray node silently departs

## Best/Worst case scenario

In the worst case, the election starts from node 0, who tries to bully nodes 1-9. Node 1 responds first, bullying 0 into submission and Node 1 tries to bully nodes 2-9, and so forth.

We simulate this by adding a delay to the handling of the election messages in the node listener, equivalent to the node id *1000ms

We also stop the highest numbered node, 9, from immediately declaring itself victor.

In the best case, the election starts from the highest numbered node, 9, who sends victory messages immediately. We have the minimum number of messages.

We simulate this by only allowing node 9 to declare itself the victor. Unfortunately, if node 9 goes down hypothetically, then there will be no coordinator.

## Failure during election

When sending victory messages, only send to the bottom few.

Down a node during an election.


do i need pause?
i need a switch to best or worst case?
